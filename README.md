# Sorting_Algorithms_Interactive_Learning_Tool
Java project for an interactive learning tool to visualize some sorting algorithms
# Currently Added Sorting Alogrithms
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Shell Sort
- Quick Sort
# Problems:
- Creating an exucutable .Jar file works but the file itself doesn't; need to find the problem.
- for now can only work by running the main in IDE (I used Eclipse).
- Not well commented; a little messing but still kinda organized. Have fun.
